# Holy Grail
Application for automatic tracking of Holy Grail challenge progress in Diablo 2 Resurrected (for offline characters)
Made with Electron, React and Typescript.

MODIFIED BY PYROSPLAT

FEATURES:
Sundered charms are now part of the grail tracker
Toggle switch to save your found items (Items persist now so you dont have to keep them on mules or in stash) - See Settings to enable
The ‚ÄúPreviously found‚Äù badge appears and a grayed out checkmark is displayed next to the items on the list (This counts towards the grail when activated)
The "Only missing" filter hides items that are historically found (when the setting is ON).
The totals in Summary reflect the historically found item count (when the setting is ON).
The "Clear persistent history" dialog works and totals/badges update instantly. - Caution this is permanant!
Some App Theme Changes + Font for my own preferences
